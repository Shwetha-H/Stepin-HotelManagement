# Requirements
## Introduction
In this project a version of scientific calculator program in C is developed which will perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder  and few scientific operations like squareroot, cuberoot and etc. depending on the input from the user.

## Objective
The main objectives of the project are:
* To perform the required mathematical operation selected by the user.
* Output the same result if the entered choice meets the requirement.

## ***4 W's and 1 H***
## Who
- Can be used as reference for programmers trying to develop a  higher version for calculation.
## What
- This project is concerned about solving a mathematical operation.
## When 
- This project is used widely in any situation where quick access to certain mathematical functions is needed like trignometric functions.
## Why
- As this project uses simple functions, it is easy for begineers to develop a programm.
## How
- Implemented using simple switch cases and other functionalities of C.
- This Project is implemented in C language for the Both Windows & Linux OS
- Project is developed using a multi file approach.


Basic requirements that are very essential are:
* gcc compiler with a good system.
* Any of the two linux/windows.
