# Requirements
## Introduction
In this project a version of scientific calculator program in C is developed which will perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder  and few scientific operations like squareroot, cuberoot and etc. depending on the input from the user.

## Objective
The main objectives of the project are:
* To perform the required mathematical operation selected by the user.
* Output the same result if the entered choice meets the requirement.

## SWOT Analysis

## ***4 W's and 1 H***
## Who
- 
## What
This project is concerned about solving the Rubik's cube by using layer by layer method.
## When 
- This project is used widely in any situation where quick access to certain mathematical functions is needed like trignometric functions.
## Why
As this project uses beginner's algorithm it can be easy to teach beginners who does not know how to solve it.
## How
