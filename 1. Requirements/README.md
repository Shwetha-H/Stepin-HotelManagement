# Requirements
## Introduction
In this project a version of scientific calculator program in C is developed which will perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder  and few scientific operations like squareroot, cuberoot and etc. depending on the input from the user.

## Objective
The main objectives of the project are:
* To perform the required mathematical operation selected by the user.
* Output the same result if the entered choice meets the requirement.
